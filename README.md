### List Operations & Methods

---

Answer each of the following questions in a separate Python file. In your heading, put your name and the date you began working on the file. Name each file hw10-2-question_number.

Example
```
hw10-4-1.py
```

1. Two words are anagrams if you can rearrange the letters from one to spell the other. Write a program that prompts the user to input a word, then input another word. The program should then check if the words are anagrams and print the result. (5 pts.)

2. Write a program that prompts a user for a list and then checks if the list is sorted or not and prints the result. (5 pts.)

3. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a list of 5 numbers separated by spaces and then calculates the sum of all the numbers in the list. (5 pts.)

4. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a list of items separated by spaces. The program should then ask if the user wants the middle or ends of their input. If the user selects 'middle', print all but the first and last elements of the list. If the user selects 'ends', print the first and last element of the list. (5 pts.)
