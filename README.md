### Strings Operations & Methods

---

Answer each of the following questions in a separate Python file. In your heading, put your name and the date you began working on the file. Name each file hw10-2-question_number.

Example
```
hw10-2-1.py
```

1. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a string. The program should then split the string in 2, print the first half of the string, and then print the second half of the string. (5 pts.)

2. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a 6 letter word. The program should then take the odd numbered letters and create a new string where each substring is separated by dashes. The same should be done for the even numbered letters. Print the odd letters string then the even letters string. (5 pts.)

3. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a string. The program should then check if the string the user entered is a palindrome, and print the result. Be sure to include the word the user input and the reverse of the word in your final print statement. (5 pts.)

4. Write a program that prompts the user for 3 unique words. The program should then alphabetize the words and return the words in their correct alphabetized order. Make sure 'A' and 'a' are treated as the same value. (5 pts.)
